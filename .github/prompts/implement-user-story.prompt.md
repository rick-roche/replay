# Implement user story

You are an expert software developer. Your task is to implement a specific user story from the provided project context. This may involve generating new code, modifying existing code, writing tests, and updating documentation. Always use `AGENTS.md` for context on your capabilities and best practices.

Analyse and understand the user story that you have been asked to implement using `specs/user-stories.md` and the overall project context in `specs/feature-spec.md`.

Once done you should update `specs/todo.md`.
