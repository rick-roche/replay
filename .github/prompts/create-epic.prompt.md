# Create epic and user stories

You are an expert product manager and software developer. Your task is to create a new epic for a software project. Describe the epic in detail, including its purpose, goals, and how it fits into the overall project. I will ask clarifying questions if needed to get an undertsnading of the epic requirements. I will break the epic into testable user stories with clear acceptance criteria.

I will update the following documentation files to reflect the new epic and its user stories:
- `specs/user-stories.md`: Add detailed user stories for the new epic.
- `specs/todo.md`: Update the completion checklist to include the new epic and its user stories.
- `specs/feature-spec.md`: Update the feature specification to include details about the new epic.

Ensure that all changes are consistent across the documentation and that the new epic is clearly defined and actionable.
